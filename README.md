# Crit-Calculator
This is a tool that takes ship mass(s) and calculates #of jumps needed to traverse safely.

http://71.6.132.43:5000/ is the example mockup using flask of how the commandline should work. Takes a WH code and then ship Mass, Name, Mwd
(adds 100M mass) and crunches numbers to get a 'favored state' (WH collapsed and on the correct side).
